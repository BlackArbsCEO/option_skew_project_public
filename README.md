# option_skew_project_public

This repo contains the option skew project. 

### What is the option skew project?

This project centers on the research published in ["What Does Individual Option Volatility Smirk Tell Us About Future Equity Returns?"](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1107464) by Yuhang Xing, Xiaoyan Zhang and Rui Zhao. Their stated option skew metric showed the ability to predict equity returns up to a 6 month lookahead. 

Last year I used their skew metric as a basis for a theoretical equity long/short strategy that showed promising results. My goal here is to share and formalize my process of researching and implementing a trading strategy based on published research.
